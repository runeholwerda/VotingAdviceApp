# VotingAdviceApp

This project is a revamped version of the well-known "Stemwijzer application," designed to assist users in selecting a political party. 
The program utilizes a Google Sheets page to analyze questions, various political parties, and the corresponding calculations for each question.
The program will extract data streams from the form and organize them into multiple arrays. 
It will then iterate through these lists, prompting the user to express their preferences on each question. 
Depending on their responses, the program will assign a numerical score. Upon completion, the user will receive a total score, revealing which political party aligns most with their views.

In addition to inquiring about your political preferences, it can seamlessly adapt to various types of questionnaires. 
By simply altering the Google Sheets file and placing it in the designated directory, you can customize the program for different types of questionnaires.
